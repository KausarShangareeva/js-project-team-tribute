# 🌟 My First Project

Welcome to my very first coding project! This is the start of my programming journey. I worked together with **@mikaelasturk** and **@carro-barro  ** at **Technigo** school. This project helped me learn the basics of coding and teamwork.

## 🚀 What I Learned
- How to collaborate in a team on GitHub  
- Basic HTML, CSS
- Project structure and file organization  
- Committing and pushing code
